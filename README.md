## Data sharing
In this repo, we publish a synthetic collection of three datasets generated by our proposed methodology (the following paper [1]). More details are shown in the corresponding subsection.

## Synthetic collection of three data sets

This collection includes the synthetic aging brain T1 MRI scans derived from three data sets: two publicly available data sets i) OASIS-3, ii) [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/about/), and a new data set GENIC from our collaborator [Daniel Ferreira Padilla](https://medarbetare.ki.se/people/daniel-ferreira-padilla). Note that the goal of this project is to augment the **HEALTHY** longitudinal brain MRI data as much as possible at different ages. 

The details of three synthetic data sets are shown as follows:
```
DATA SET      NUMBER OF SYNTHETIC SCANS      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS      
OASIS-3       3948                           347
ADNI          2500                           353
GENIC         1100                           96
```

Each directory contains a series of synthetic T1-w scans and corresponding segmentation for each subject. All segmentations are collected by using FreeSurfer ([aparc+aseg.mgz](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/ReconAllDevTable)). Details for each directory are shown as follows:
```
FILENAME      SHAPE             SPACE
imgX.nii.gz   160 x 160 x 192   synthetic scan in template space
segX.nii.gz   160 x 160 x 192   corresponding segmentation in template space
```
In addition, we also provide the metadata file, including `linear ages` and `regressed ages` for each synthetic scan for each data set, respectively. Please refer to paper [1] for more details on the age assignment.

## Data Use Agreement
- [OASIS-3](https://www.oasis-brains.org/#access)
- [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/#access_data)
- [GENIC] A reasonable request should be sent to [Daniel Ferreira Padilla](https://medarbetare.ki.se/people/daniel-ferreira-padilla) to access the data
