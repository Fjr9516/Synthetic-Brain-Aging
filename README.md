# Synthetic-Brain-Aging

In this repo, we publish two datasets: i) A true dataset including 2044 images from the open-access OASIS-3 dataset, which have been processed with FreeSurfer to suit the standard machine learning algorithm; ii) A synthetic collection of three datasets, which is generated by our proposed methodology (the following paper [1]), more details are shown in the corresponding subsection. 

If you use either of these datasets, please cite the following and refer to the corresponding Data Use Agreement.

## True data collection from [OASIS-3](https://www.oasis-brains.org/#access)
Each directory contains one processed T1 weighted scan (`img.nii,gz`) and the corresponding label segmentation (`seg.nii.gz`). We collected the skull stripped and bias-corrected 'norm' images with FreeSufer, and then used the talairach.xfm to affine align all T1-w scans. In order to fit the most machine learning algorithm, we further rescale the intensity of each scan between [0,1]. Details for each directory are shown as follows:
```
FILENAME SHAPE SPACE
img.nii.gz 256x256x256 rescaled norm scan in templete space
seg.nii.gz 256x256x256 corresponding segmentation in templete space
```
We also provide a metadata file including the age, gender, and healthy/not info.
