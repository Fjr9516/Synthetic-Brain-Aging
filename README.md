# Synthetic-Brain-Aging

In this repo, we publish two datasets: i) A true dataset including 2044 images from the open-access OASIS-3 dataset, which have been processed with FreeSurfer to suit the standard machine learning algorithm; ii) A synthetic collection of three datasets, which is generated by our proposed methodology (the following paper [1]), more details show in the corresponding subsection. 

If you use either of these dataset, please cite the following and refer to the correspondng Data Use Agreement.
